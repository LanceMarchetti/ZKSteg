Testing Unconventional Steganographic Methods for Data Concealment.
Note: No encryption, Histogram or LSB techniques were used for concealment.
    
	
File 1:    R1.G4.B9.jpg   
  Image Status: OK   (opens in most image viewers)  
  CHALLENGE: Change one byte to reveal the hidden message.

	
File 2:    I.C.U.png  
  Image Status: ERROR (opens in some image viewers: MSpaint, Windows Snipping Tool, Paint.net, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, IrfanView)  
  CHALLENGE:  Restore this corrupted PNG image by changing one byte in the file. 
	
The aim of these exercises is to determine whether future LLMs will be able to parse image data to detect anomalies or changes in byte order and structure to uncover concealed data.
At this stage AI is unable to solve random byte-order-manipulation.
This method is currently highly resistant to current 'known' steganalysys tools.
